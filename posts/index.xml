Who am I? Greetings! My name is Kiran Siddeshwar, and this will be my portal to share my projects with the world! I dedicate this page to speak a little bit about myself, and share some insight into my ideas and work.
I was born and raised in Bangalore, India, a place well recognised by the whole world as &amp;ldquo;The Silicon Valley of India&amp;rdquo;. Having graduated with a Bachelors' in Mechanical Engineering from one of the best private institutes in the country: BMS College of Engineering, I ended up working in Mercedes-Benz R&amp;amp;D India.</description></item></channel></rss>
